The goal was to make an app that you can co-ordinate participant in a workplace/family/club etc secret santa event.</p>\n\n<p>The admin creates an event which generates a link. This link can then be shared with participants. The participants can then sign-up to be part of the secret santa, generating a UUID so that they have a page to return to. On their page the participants can suggest presents that they might like to receive (or things they do not want) until the secret santa parings are drawn by the admin. Once the admin does the draw, the event changes so that all participant UUID’s now display the person who they need to buy a present for along with their wish list.</p>\n\n<p>A large part of this project was also to test as many aspects as the app as possible. As a group we completed 70 passing tests for a final test coverage of 90%.</p>\n\n<p>Much of this project was completed by practicing pair-programming and Agile methodology. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/createevent.png\" alt=\"Sea\" width=\"1843\" height=\"1356\" /></p>\n\n<p>With this project their are some changes and extensions that I would like to do beyond the work that my group did.
